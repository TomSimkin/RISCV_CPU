# RISCV_CPU
Designed and simulated a 6-stage pipelined 16-bit CPU architecture using Vivado.

This simulated CPU has 6 components: register file, decoder, ALU, control unit, program counter and ram/memory.
Check out the PDF file for my explanation of the CPU and to see the ISA.

To simulate the project itself, you need to download the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite (for Windows 10 I used the ISE Archive)
